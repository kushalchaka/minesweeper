# minesweeper
A GUI-based Minesweeper implementation using Java Swing. Players click on tiles to reveal safe spots while avoiding hidden mines. Flags can be placed on suspected mines, and the game tracks elapsed time. Supports multiple difficulty levels ranging from “baby” to “impossible.”
Features:

- Interactive grid with clickable tiles and flagging functionality.

- Multiple difficulty levels with adjustable mine counts.

- Real-time timer displayed on the interface.

- Automatic game-over detection when a mine is clicked.

- Win detection when all non-mine tiles are revealed.

 If you are having issues with viewing the images, then ensure that the image directories in the code match the locations of the actual images on your system
